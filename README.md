### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a graduate of the ALX-Holberton Software Engineering program

From writing low-level C programs to building web apps with JavaScript and Python, I’ve picked up a wide range of skills that help me turn ideas into working projects. I enjoy solving real-world problems, learning in public, and building with others.

I’m especially drawn to responsive, clean systems, and tools that make dev work smoother and faster. I really enjoy good music and lofi sounds.
